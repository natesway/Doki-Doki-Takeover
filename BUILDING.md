# Build instructions

## Installing the required programs

You will need to install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) (4.2.4+), [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) (5.0.0+), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

You also need to install additional libraries. These can be installed either via Haxe Module Manager, or manually.
The following is for if you want to install them manually:

```text
haxelib install firetongue
haxelib install flxanimate
haxelib git hxCodec https://github.com/polybiusproxy/hxCodec.git
haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc.git
```

If you're on Linux, you'll need to install libvlc. If you are on Arch, the AUR package is outdated so you'll need to install vlc instead.
The following is for distributions based off Ubuntu:

```text
sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev
sudo apt-get install libvlccore-dev
```

You should have everything ready for compiling the game; follow the guide below to continue!

## Compiling the game

**NOTE: If you see any messages relating to deprecated packages, ignore them. They're just warnings that don't affect compiling.**

To compile it on your desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) it is a bit more involved, as you ***MUST*** be on the platform that you are compiling for.

Once the compilation finishes, Doki Doki Takeover will boot up automatically.

### Windows Compilation

For Windows, you need to install [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Don't click on any of the options to install workloads. Instead, go to the individual components tab and search up the following:

- MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)
- Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0)

Once that is done you can open up a command line in the project's directory and run `lime test windows -debug`.

### Linux Compilation

For Linux, you can either compile via WSL 2.0 (Windows) or on a Linux kernel.

You only need to open a terminal in the project directory and run `lime test linux -debug`.

### Mac Compilation

For Mac, install Xcode and `lime test mac -debug` *should* just work; if not, the internet surely has a guide on how to compile Haxe stuff for Mac.
