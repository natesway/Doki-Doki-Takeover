:senpai:Wait-
:senpai:Is that my microphone? How the hell did you get that?
:senpai:...
:senpai:Who is this guy and why does he look so much like me?!
:bfhmm:Huh.
:bfhmm:It looks like this game couldn't function without me so it had to create a new Senpai to replace me.
:senpai:What?
:bfhmm:Nevermind. You wouldn't get it.
:senpai:ENOUGH!
:senpai:I don't get any of this game stuff you're talking about but that's my microphone so give it back!
:monikagasp:Hey, its not-
:senpai:Give it back! I need to show this guy who's the real Senpai.
:monikagasp:Huh? No, wait, I was just about to-
:senpai:I said GIVE IT!
:monikagasp:N-no!
:bfhmm:Well this is awkward.
:bfhyped:Oh and you're on!
:tankman:Mind if I join in?
:bf:Sure, why not!
:bf:Did you bring your mic?
:tankman:No.
:tankman:I was kinda hoping we could do what they're doing without the fighting.
:bf:That works.
:bfhyped:But I call hold dibs.
:tankman:Deal!
