:monikagaspleft:Hey, you're back!
:bf:Yeah.
:bf:I heard about the new update to your mod so I came back to see what you've got!
:monikagaspleft:Wait. Doesn't this mean you're stuck in here again?
:bf:Nope.
:bf:I became way stronger after some guy with a green shirt gave me 0.002% of his power.
:bf:Now I can leave and reenter this game whenever I want.
:monikagaspleft:Huh.
:bf:Anyways, has that worm come to fight you yet?
:monikagaspleft:Not yet.
:monikahmm:He seems to be taking a while to get here.
:bfhmm:I see.
:bf:How about we sing something while waiting for him?
:monikahappy:I'd love to!
:monika:By the way, who's your friend here?
:tankman:The name's Sergeant John Captain.
:tankman:Just call me Tankman.
:bf:We became friends after he was trapped in here by HER dad.
:monikagaspleft:I see.
:monika:Well then.
:monikahappy:Let's sing!
